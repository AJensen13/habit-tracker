		<p class="has-text-left">You can do it. Let your imagination be your guide. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>

		<p class="has-text-left">Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Imagination is the key to painting. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>

		<p class="has-text-left">Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Every day I learn. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.</p>

		<p class="has-text-left">This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll have a super time. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Here's another little happy bush This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You can do anything your heart can imagine.</p>

		<p class="has-text-left">I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. See there, told you that would be easy. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>
